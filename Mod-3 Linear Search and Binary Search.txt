CSE 1204 (Data Structure Lab) 
Module 3: (for Week 3) 
Topic 1: [ Linear Search] 
i) Draw a flowchart to search an element in array ax[] using sequential search. 
ii) Write a c++ program using class and object for the above algorithm. 
iii) Create a table with the runtime values of the different variables and logical 
expression of the above C++ program. 
iv) Calculate the complexity of the algorithm. 
 
Topic 2: [ Binary Search] 
i) Draw a flowchart to search an element in array ax[] using binary search. 
ii) Write a c++ program using class and object for the above algorithm. 
iii) Create a table with the runtime values of the different variables and logical 
expression of the above C++ program. 
iv) Calculate the complexity of the algorithm. 
[Menu Program]: Write a menu program to implement the above two topic. Declare the 
array and the size of the array as the private members of the class.
